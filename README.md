# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to my first challenge on Frontend Mentor, the [QR code component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H)! Although it's a very simple one, I think it was a good (and fun) start to begin exploring what the platform has - and to improve my frontend skills.
